===BEGIN====

pip install -r requirements.txt

By default, the user is: username: admin password: super_secure_password

It is recommended to delete the shop.db file before the first run (this will remove the default user). 
(The user will be created anew when running backend.py). 
In the backend.py file, change the host and port in the last line of code to your own settings.

Next, run the backend.py file. If you have deleted the shop.db file, you can add a user. First, in the add_user.py file, 
change the username and password in the last line of code to your desired settings. Then, run the add_user.py file. 
It will add the user and password to the shop.db file.

====ADDING AND REMOVING OFFERS====

To access the admin page, you need to enter \admin after the address of your store's page, e.g., "http://127.0.0.1/admin". 
There, you will first be greeted by the login page, where you must enter your username and password. 
After logging in, you will see the page for adding and removing offers, 
which is simple enough for even your grandmother, who struggles with using a computer without you, to handle.

That's all, best wishes!
